#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a third-year Master's student majoring in computer science at [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/), currently working with [Prof. Xu Chen](https://sites.google.com/view/xcsysu/home). My current research interests focus on resource-efficient AI, particularly deploying models on resource-constrained edge devices. Before pursuing my Master's degree, I received my B.E. degree from [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/) advised by [Prof. Yu Chao](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/YuChao).
